The wind moves softly through the trees,
A whisper carried on the breeze.
The sky wears clouds like woven thread,
While dreams arise from where we tread.

A moment lost, a memory found,
In silence deeper than a sound.
We chase the light, we fear the dark,
Yet both reside within our heart.

So let us walk, though paths may bend,
Each step a start, not just an end.
